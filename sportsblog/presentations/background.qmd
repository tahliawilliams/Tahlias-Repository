Question: How do total penalty yards per game for college football teams correlate with their likelihood of winning, and how do factors like turnovers, opponent strength, or home/away status affect this relationship?


Does the data alreadt exist? Can you get it?
Yes, game by game college football data is avaliable from NCAA Stats, ESPN, and Sports Reference, including penalty yars, points scored, turnovers, and game outcomes

Do you need assistance getting it?
Potentially if using tables is needed. Otherwise, CSV downloads are avaliable 

Time frame needed: The last five seasons (2019-2025) to capture recent trends

Will you need to improve or augment the data? Yes, I may need to combine multiple sources, and use that to identify penalties, points, and turnovers in columns. 

Other examples: Sports blogs examine penalties, turnovers, and win probability like Football Outsiders, The Last Man Analytics and The Extra Point. 

```{r}
Football_data |> 
  group_by(Opponent) |> 
summarise(Game = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(Game))
            
```



```{r}
Football_data |> 
  group_by(Outcome) |> 
  summarise(Game = n())
```

```{r}
Football_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Outcome, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Game Outcomes",
       x = "Outcome",
       y = "Number of Games") +
  theme_minimal()

```

A challenge I encountered is that the dataset doesn't include consistent formatting and is missing thr values for team names and other stats. Additionally, because the data is only data from games, I may need to merge it with another data set to answer a broader question. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

attendance <- read_csv("https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/attendance.csv")
```
