# Career Pathways Analysis

This notebook explores common career pathways for NCAA women's basketball coaches, focusing on how coaches progress through different positions on their way to becoming head coaches.

## Data Loading and Preparation

First, we'll load the coaching data and apply the position title standardization from the previous notebook.

```{r load-and-prepare}
# Load the coaching histories data
coaching_data <- fromJSON("data/coaching_histories.json", flatten = FALSE)

# Create a data frame with nested structures
coaches_df <- coaching_data |>
  as_tibble() |>
  mutate(coach_id = row_number())

# Unnest positions for analysis
positions_df <- coaches_df |>
  select(coach_id, name, team, positions) |>
  unnest(positions, keep_empty = TRUE) |>
  rename(
    position_college = college,
    position_title = title,
    position_start = start_year,
    position_end = end_year
  )

# Apply the standardization function from coaches.Rmd
standardize_position_title <- function(title) {
  if (is.na(title)) return(NA_character_)

  title_lower <- str_to_lower(title)
  title_lower <- str_replace_all(title_lower, "the .+ (head|assistant|associate)", "\\1")
  title_clean <- str_replace_all(title_lower, " */ *", " / ")
  title_clean <- str_replace_all(title_clean, " *& *| and ", " / ")
  title_clean <- str_replace_all(title_clean, " *, *", " / ")

  case_when(
    str_detect(title_clean, "interim.*head.*coach") ~ "Interim Head Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "head.*coach") ~ "Head Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "acting.*head.*coach") ~ "Interim Head Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "associate.*head") ~ "Associate Head Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "associate.*coach") ~ "Associate Head Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "coach") ~ "Assistant Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "recruiting.*coordinator") ~ "Recruiting Coordinator",
    str_detect(title_clean, "offensive.*coordinator") ~ "Offensive Coordinator",
    str_detect(title_clean, "defensive.*coordinator") ~ "Defensive Coordinator",
    str_detect(title_clean, "director.*basketball.*operations") ~ "Director of Basketball Operations",
    str_detect(title_clean, "director.*operations") ~ "Director of Basketball Operations",
    str_detect(title_clean, "director.*player.*development") ~ "Director of Player Development",
    str_detect(title_clean, "director.*recruiting") ~ "Recruiting Coordinator",
    str_detect(title_clean, "player.*development") ~ "Director of Player Development",
    str_detect(title_clean, "graduate.*assistant") ~ "Graduate Assistant",
    str_detect(title_clean, "graduate.*manager") ~ "Graduate Assistant",
    str_detect(title_clean, "volunteer.*assistant") ~ "Volunteer Assistant",
    str_detect(title_clean, "video.*coordinator") ~ "Video Coordinator",
    str_detect(title_clean, "strength.*conditioning") ~ "Strength and Conditioning Coach",
    str_detect(title_clean, "athletic.*trainer") ~ "Athletic Trainer",
    str_detect(title_clean, "student.*manager") ~ "Student Manager",
    str_detect(title_clean, "student.*assistant") ~ "Student Assistant",
    str_detect(title_clean, "team.*manager") ~ "Manager",
    str_detect(title_clean, "^manager$") ~ "Manager",
    str_detect(title_clean, "administrative.*assistant") ~ "Administrative Assistant",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )
}

# Apply standardization
positions_standardized <- positions_df |>
  mutate(
    position_title_standardized = sapply(position_title, standardize_position_title),
    position_title_original = position_title
  )

cat("Total coaches:", nrow(coaches_df), "\n")
cat("Total position records:", nrow(positions_standardized), "\n")
```
```{r}
positions_standardized <- read_csv("../data/positions_standardized.csv")
positions_standardized |> distinct(position_title_standardized)
```

## Identifying Career Coaching Positions

For career pathway analysis, we'll focus on positions that are part of the traditional coaching track. Let's define which positions are considered "coaching positions" versus support or administrative roles.

```{r define-coaching-positions}
# Define what we consider "coaching" positions for career pathway analysis
# EXERCISE: complete this list with the appropriate position types
coaching_positions <- c(
  "Head Coach",
  "Interim Head Coach",
  "Associate Head Coach",
  "Assistant Coach",
  "Strength and Conditioning Coach",  
  "Offensive Coordinator",
  "Defensive Coordinator"
)

# Filter to only coaching/recruiting/development positions
# This includes any position with "coach", "recruiting", or "development" in the standardized title
coaching_roles <- positions_standardized |>
  filter(
    str_detect(str_to_lower(position_title_standardized), "coach|recruiting|development")
  ) |>
  arrange(name, position_start)

cat("Total coaching/recruiting/development position records:", nrow(coaching_roles), "\n")
cat("Unique coaches with these positions:", n_distinct(coaching_roles$name), "\n")
```

## Question 1: Head Coaches' Previous Positions

**Research Question:** How many current or former Head Coaches were Associate Head Coaches in their immediate previous position versus Assistant Coaches?

```{r head-coach-previous-positions}
# Step 1: Identify all head coaching positions
head_coach_positions <- coaching_roles |>
  filter(position_title_standardized == "Head Coach") |>
  select(coach_id, name, position_college, position_start, position_end)

cat("Found", nrow(head_coach_positions), "head coaching positions\n")

# Step 2: For each head coach position, find their immediately previous position
# We'll create a dataset with each head coach position and their previous role
head_coach_with_previous <- coaching_roles |>
  # Order positions by coach and time
  arrange(name, position_start) |>
  # For each coach, add a column with the next position's standardized title
  group_by(name) |>
  mutate(next_position = lead(position_title_standardized)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  # Filter to positions where the NEXT position was Head Coach
  filter(next_position == "Head Coach")  # EXERCISE: Fill in the position type

# Step 3: Count previous positions before becoming head coach
previous_position_counts <- head_coach_with_previous |>
  count(position_title_standardized, sort = TRUE)

cat("\nPositions held immediately before becoming Head Coach:\n")
print(previous_position_counts, n = 20)

# Step 4: Compare Associate Head Coach vs Assistant Coach specifically
associate_count <- previous_position_counts |>
  filter(position_title_standardized == "Associate Head Coach") |>
  pull(n) |>
  sum()

assistant_count <- previous_position_counts |>
  filter(position_title_standardized == "Assistant Coach") |>  # EXERCISE: Fill in
  pull(n) |>
  sum()

cat("Associate Head Coach → Head Coach:", associate_count, "\n")
cat("Assistant Coach → Head Coach:", assistant_count, "\n")
cat("Ratio (Associate:Assistant):",
    round(associate_count / assistant_count, 2), ":1\n")
```

### Interpretation

**EXERCISE:** Based on the results above, write a couple of sentences interpreting what this tells us about the typical career path to becoming a head coach. Which position is more common as a stepping stone?

The data shows that majority of head coaches come directly from assistant coaching roles. With 1,482 coaches being promoted from Assistant Coach to Head Coach, compared to the 7 that became head coaches after being associate head coach. 

---

## Question 2: Head Coaches with Recruiting Experience

**Research Question:** How many Head Coaches previously held positions with "recruiting" in the title?

```{r head-coaches-recruiting-background}
# Step 1: Identify coaches who have been head coaches
head_coaches_list <- coaching_roles |>
  filter(position_title_standardized == "Head Coach") |>
  distinct(name) |>
  pull(name)

cat("Unique individuals who have been head coaches:", length(head_coaches_list), "\n")

# Step 2: For these head coaches, check if they ever had a recruiting position
# EXERCISE: Complete the filter condition to find recruiting-related positions
recruiting_positions_keywords <- "recruiting"  # This will match any position with "recruiting"

head_coaches_with_recruiting <- coaching_roles |>
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_list) |>
  # Check if position title (original) contains recruiting keywords
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(position_title_original), recruiting_positions_keywords)) |>
  distinct(name, team)

# Count results
num_with_recruiting <- nrow(head_coaches_with_recruiting)
num_without_recruiting <- length(head_coaches_list) - num_with_recruiting
percentage_with_recruiting <- round(num_with_recruiting / length(head_coaches_list) * 100, 1)

cat("\n=== Recruiting Experience Analysis ===\n")
cat("Head coaches who previously had recruiting positions:", num_with_recruiting, "\n")
cat("Head coaches without recruiting positions in their history:", num_without_recruiting, "\n")
cat("Percentage with recruiting experience:", percentage_with_recruiting, "%\n")

# Show examples of recruiting positions held by future head coaches
cat("\nExamples of recruiting positions held by head coaches:\n")
coaching_roles |>
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_with_recruiting$name) |>
  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(position_title_original), recruiting_positions_keywords)) |>
  select(name, position_title_original, position_college, position_start) |>
  print()
```

### Reflection Question

**EXERCISE:** Why might recruiting experience be valuable (or not valuable) for someone aspiring to become a head coach? Write a brief response below? What would a good question or potential story idea be based on these findings?

Recruiting experience is important because it builds skill in relationship building, and navigating the rules and logistics of college athletics. Coaches who recruit well can shape a roster that fits their team. However, the data suggests recruiting roles aren't the main pathway to becoming a head coach. Only about 24% of head coaches previously held a recruiting specific position so it clearly inst essential. A good story angle would be if recruiting is like backbone of college basketball, and why do so little head coaches come from recruiting specific backgrounds?

## Question 3: Common Career Pathways

```{r common-pathways}
# Create career sequences for all coaches who became head coaches
# We'll look at the full sequence of positions for each person

career_sequences <- coaching_roles |>
  # Filter to people who eventually became head coaches
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_list) |>
  # Order by time
  arrange(name, position_start) |>
  # Group by person
  group_by(name) |>
  # Create a sequence of positions as a string
  summarize(
    career_path = paste(position_title_standardized, collapse = " → "),
    num_positions = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# EXERCISE: Find the most common career paths
# Count how many coaches followed each unique pathway
pathway_frequencies <- career_sequences |>
  count(career_path, sort = TRUE)

cat("Total unique career pathways to head coach:", nrow(pathway_frequencies), "\n\n")
cat("Top 15 most common career pathways:\n")
print(pathway_frequencies |> head(15), n = 15)

# Analyze pathway lengths
career_sequences |>
  count(num_positions) |>
  arrange(num_positions) |>
  mutate(percentage = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) |>
  print(n = 20)
```
**EXERCISE:**: Describe these findings in a few sentences. Are there common lengths of careers? Do most coaches have many positions before becoming head coaches, or just a few? Use an example or two for contrast.

Most coaches work through many positions before becoming head coaches. However, the most common number of positions is between four and six with the largest group having fuce roles (about 18%) and another large froup having four (about 17%). Very few coaches jump straight into a head coaching job with only one or two years prior of experience, and only a small amount stay in the profession long enough to hold eight or more roles. Many coaches work their way uo through multiple assistant roles and some move through four or five positions before becoming a head coach. Overall, the pattern leans toward gradual progression through different assistant jobs instead of just jumping into head coaching positions

## Position Transition Analysis

Let's analyze which position transitions are most common, regardless of where they occur in a career.

```{r position-transitions}
# For each person, create pairs of consecutive positions
# This shows us "Position A → Position B" transition frequencies

position_transitions <- coaching_roles |>
  arrange(name, position_start) |>
  group_by(name) |>
  mutate(
    next_position = lead(position_title_standardized),
    transition = paste(position_title_standardized, "→", next_position)
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  # Remove the last position for each person (no transition after it)
  filter(!is.na(next_position))

# Count transition frequencies
transition_frequencies <- position_transitions |>
  count(transition, sort = TRUE)

cat("Total position transitions:", nrow(position_transitions), "\n\n")
cat("Top 20 most common position transitions:\n")
print(transition_frequencies |> head(20), n = 20)

# EXERCISE: Filter to only transitions that END in "Head Coach"
transitions_to_head_coach <- transition_frequencies |>
  filter(str_detect(transition, "→ Head Coach"))  # EXERCISE: Fill in

cat("\n=== Transitions specifically to Head Coach ===\n")
print(transitions_to_head_coach, n = 20)
```

**EXERCISE:** Based on the transition data, what are the most interesting immediate previous positions in the transitions described here? What might a good story focus on?

The most interesting immediate previous positions are the oens that stand out from the usual ladder. Most head coaches come directly from assistant coach roles (1,482) or move from one head coaching job to another (1,184). But the rare transitions between roles tells a better story, like only 43 coaches became head coaches after serving as interm head coaches, and fewer came from roles like recruiting coordinator (27), director of player development (4), or strength and conditioning (1). A strong story could focus on the unusual and rare paths and what they should about breaking into leadership from nontraditional roles. We could look at the head coach to assistant coach transition which appears over 1,000 times. With a significant number like that, it raises questions about what leads a coach to move down the ladder after holding the top job. Another good angle would be interim head coach to assistant coach which is only 50 cases. These coaches briefly held a top spot but didnt keep it. Their experiences could reveal the impact of stepping back after being the big guy.

## Visualization: Career Pathway Sankey Diagram Data

To visualize career pathways, we can prepare data for a Sankey diagram. This shows the flow of people between different positions.

```{r sankey-prep}
# Prepare data for first transition (Position 1 → Position 2)
first_transitions <- coaching_roles |>
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_list) |>
  arrange(name, position_start) |>
  group_by(name) |>
  mutate(position_sequence = row_number()) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(position_sequence <= 2) |>
  select(name, position_sequence, position_title_standardized) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = position_sequence,
    values_from = position_title_standardized,
    names_prefix = "position_"
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(position_1) & !is.na(position_2))

# Count flows from position 1 to position 2
first_transition_counts <- first_transitions |>
  count(position_1, position_2, name = "count", sort = TRUE)

cat("First career transitions for eventual head coaches:\n")
print(first_transition_counts |> head(15), n = 15)

# EXERCISE: Create similar data for position_2 → position_3 transitions
# This will show the second career move for people who had at least 3 positions
```

---

## Development and Operations Roles

Let's also look at coaches who came through "development" or "operations" pathways:

```{r development-operations-pathways}
# Identify coaches who held Director of Player Development or
# Director of Basketball Operations roles

development_ops_positions <- c(
  "Director of Player Development",
  "Director of Basketball Operations"
)

# Find head coaches who previously held these positions
head_coaches_from_dev_ops <- coaching_roles |>
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_list) |>
  filter(position_title_standardized %in% development_ops_positions) |>
  distinct(name)

cat("Head coaches who previously held development/operations roles:",
    nrow(head_coaches_from_dev_ops), "\n")
cat("Percentage:",
    round(nrow(head_coaches_from_dev_ops) / length(head_coaches_list) * 100, 1),
    "%\n\n")

# Show their career paths
cat("Sample career paths through development/operations:\n")
career_sequences |>
  filter(name %in% head_coaches_from_dev_ops$name) |>
  print()
```

---

## Summary

**EXERCISE:** Based on all the analyses above, write a summary that answers:

1. What is the most common immediate previous position for someone becoming a head coach?
2. How important is recruiting experience for head coaches?
3. What are the 2-3 most common career pathways to becoming a head coach?
4. Are there any "non-traditional" pathways that appear in the data?

The most common immediate previous position for someone becoming a head coach is assistant coach, with more transitions from assistant to head coach than any other role. Recruiting experience appears to be helpful, but not extremely essential. Only a small number of coaches move directly from recruiting coordinator to head coach, possibly suggesting that it can appear to make a coach a better candidate, but it is not a primary gateway to leadership. The most common career pathways involve spending multiple years as an assistant before earning a head coaching job, or moving from head coach to another head coaching position. Some coaches also progress through a mix of assistant roles before getting promoted. There are a few non-traditional paths including jumps from director of player development, strength and conditioning coach, or recruiting coordinator into head coaching roles. These situtations are rare, but demosntrate that coaches can make their way up without following the standard assistant to head coach path
